# Employee Management System

## Overview

This project is an Employee Management System designed to streamline and automate various tasks associated with employee management, salary processing, EPF/ETF contributions, and B-Card management. The system is built using Next.js, leveraging React for the frontend and NextAuth for authentication.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React with Material-UI for a responsive and intuitive user interface.
- **Backend:** Next.js with API routes for handling server-side logic and database interactions.
- **Authentication:** NextAuth for secure, customizable authentication.
- **Database:** Integrated with a suitable database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB) to store and manage employee data.
- **State Management:** Context API and React Hooks to manage the application state.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14.x or later)
- npm or yarn
- A suitable database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/employee-management-system.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd employee-management-system
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:

   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the necessary environment variables for database connection, authentication, etc.

   ```env
   NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
   DATABASE_URL=your-database-url
   SECRET=your-secret
   ```

5. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application in the browser.

### Deployment

For deployment, consider using platforms like Vercel or Netlify for seamless integration with Next.js. Ensure to configure environment variables for the production environment as done for development.

## Usage

- Navigate to the different sections of the app to manage employees, salaries, EPF/ETF contributions, and B-Cards.
- Use the sidebar for easy navigation between different modules.
- Authentication is required for accessing the application's features.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
